%Doolittle LU Factorization
function [L,U] = DLUfactor(A)
%SForwardElim Simple Forward Elimination
% This function performs a simple forward elimination on a given square
% matrix and its RHS
%
% A= LHS matrix
% b= RHS matrix
% c= 0 if matrix needs to be catenated, and 1 if matrix is already catenated.
