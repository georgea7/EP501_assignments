%Simple Backward Elimination
function [x] = SBackElim(A,b,c)
%SBackElim Simple Back Elimination
% This function performs a simple back elimination on a given square
% matrix and its RHS
%
% A= LHS matrix
% b= RHS matrix
% c= 0 if matrix needs to be catenated, and 1 if matrix is already catenated.
%The code used to write this function was modified from a code written by Dr. Zettergen. Find it
